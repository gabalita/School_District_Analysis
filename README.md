# School District Analysis

# Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this project was to analyze and summarize student funding and standardized test scores for a local school district. The analysis will be used to understand the performance of each school and make strategic decisions about future funding. A second round of analysis was performed when inaccurate math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School were discovered. The impact of removing this false data is highlighted. 

# Results: 
**1. How is the district summary affected?**
  - After removing 9th grade Thomas High School data, the district's performance fell in almost every category. For example, the overall passing percentage decreased from 65.2% and 64.9%. On the other hand, there was no change in the average reading score. 

- In summary, although the change was miniscule, the inclusion of the inaccurate 9th grade Thomas High data artificially increased the district's performance.

**2. How is the school summary affected?**
  - Since the compromised data was confined to one high school, the school summary is largely unaffected. The changes to Thomas High are outlined more closley in the next section. 
  
**3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

*4. *How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type



# Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
